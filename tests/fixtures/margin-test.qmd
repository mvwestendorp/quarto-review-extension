# Introduction {#sec-intro}

This document is designed to test and understand how Quarto renders margin content. We'll use this to design our margin comment system.

## Main Content with Margin Notes

This is a paragraph in the main body. It should take up the standard body width, leaving room for margin content on the right.

::: {.column-margin}
This is a margin note. It appears in the right margin alongside the main content.
:::

Here's another paragraph with associated margin content. The margin should align with the content vertically.

::: {.column-margin}
Another margin note that should appear aligned with this paragraph.
:::

## Lists and Margin Content

Here's a list with margin annotations:

- First item in the list
- Second item with important context
- Third item that needs explanation

::: {.column-margin}
The margin can contain explanatory notes about the list items, providing additional context without cluttering the main content.
:::

## Multiple Margin Notes

This section has multiple margin notes to test vertical spacing and alignment.

::: {.column-margin}
**First margin note**: This is important context.
:::

Some content in between.

::: {.column-margin}
**Second margin note**: Additional information here.
:::

More main content.

::: {.column-margin}
**Third margin note**: Even more details.
:::

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block with a margin note:

```python
def example():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

::: {.column-margin}
This margin note explains the code block.
:::

## Callouts and Margin Content

::: {.callout-note}
## Important Note

This is a callout box with important information.
:::

::: {.column-margin}
Margin notes can also accompany callouts.
:::

## Testing Reference Location

Here's a citation to test reference-location: margin setting[^1].

[^1]: This footnote should appear in the margin.

## Conclusion

This document demonstrates various margin layout patterns that we can use as reference for implementing margin comments in the review extension.

::: {.column-margin}
**Final note**: The margin provides excellent space for comments and annotations without disrupting the reading flow.
