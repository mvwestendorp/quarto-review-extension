# Troubleshooting Guide

Solutions for common issues with the Quarto Review Extension.

## Search Issues

### Problem: Search not finding text

**Solutions:**
1. Check spelling (search is case-insensitive by default)
2. Enable "Case Sensitive" toggle if searching for specific capitalization
3. Disable "Whole Word" toggle if search term might be part of a larger word
4. Use simpler, shorter search terms
5. Try searching for unique parts of the text

**Example:**
```
Searching for "test" isn't finding anything?
1. Type a shorter part: "tes"
2. Try different words: "document", "review"
3. Check if you're in the right document
```

### Problem: Regex search not working

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `.*` toggle is enabled
2. Check regex syntax (use simple patterns first)
3. Remember special characters need escaping: `\.`, `\*`, `\[`
4. Test simpler patterns: `.` matches anything, `\d` matches digits

**Example Patterns:**
```
âœ“ Working: "Chapter[0-9]" finds "Chapter1", "Chapter2", etc.
âœ— Not working: "[0-9" (missing closing bracket)
âœ— Not working: "(word)" (parentheses need escaping)
```

### Problem: Search freezing

**Solutions:**
1. Close and reopen search
2. Use simpler search terms
3. Disable regex if enabled
4. Refresh the page
5. Close other browser tabs to free up memory
