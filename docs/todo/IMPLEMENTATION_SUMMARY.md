#### 8 Safe Optimization Opportunities
```
1. Refresh() inefficiency (O(n*m))    → 70% fewer DOM ops
2. Event listener accumulation        → 500 → 5 listeners
3. Milkdown memory leak               → Prevents heap growth
4. Unnecessary reflows                → 50-70% fewer reflows
5. Expensive CSS animations           → 20-30% faster
6. Unbounded operation storage        → Bounded memory
7. No debounce/throttle               → 50-70% fewer updates
8. No offline support                 → Prevents data loss
```

#### Phase 1: Quick Wins (65 minutes) ✅ Ready
1. **CSS Optimization** (20 min)
   - Remove duplicate box-shadows
   - Simplify transforms
   - Add `will-change` hints

2. **Debounce Implementation** (30 min)

### 12. Feature #12: AI-Powered Suggestions ✅ Holistic Plan

#### Comprehensive Plan Document
**File:** `FEATURE_PLAN_12_AI_INTEGRATION.md` (850+ lines)

#### AI Capabilities
1. **Grammar & Spell Check** - Real-time corrections
2. **Style Recommendations** - Passive voice, readability
3. **Duplicate Detection** - Semantic similarity
4. **Readability Analysis** - Flesch-Kincaid, CEFR levels
5. **Content Summarization** - Auto-generated section summaries
6. **Formatting Suggestions** - Consistency checking

#### Three Deployment Options

##### Option 1: Local Models (Privacy-First) 🔒
```
✅ Privacy: Data never leaves device
✅ Offline: Works without internet
✅ Zero latency: Instant suggestions
✅ No costs: Free to operate
❌ Large bundle: ~300 MB (models + runtime)
❌ Slower: Smaller models than cloud
❌ Memory: Uses 500-800 MB RAM

Models:
  - Grammar: google/flan-t5-base
  - Embeddings: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
  - Spell Check: BERT-based
```

##### Option 2: Public API (Cost-Effective) 💰
```
✅ High accuracy: Uses GPT-4, Claude-3, Google
✅ Maintenance-free: Provider handles updates
✅ No deployment: Works instantly
✅ Scalable: Handles any document size
❌ Latency: 100-500ms network delay
❌ Privacy: Data sent to external service
❌ Costs: $5-100/month depending on usage
❌ Dependencies: Service outages = no features

Providers:
  - OpenAI API ($0.0005-0.002 per 1K tokens)
  - Google Cloud NLP ($1-5 per 1M requests)
  - Anthropic Claude API
  - HuggingFace Inference API
  - AWS Comprehend
```

##### Option 3: Private API (Enterprise) 🏢
```
✅ Maximum control: Run on your infrastructure
✅ Privacy: Data never leaves organization
✅ Compliance: HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR ready
✅ Customization: Tune on your documents
✅ No variable costs: Pay only for infrastructure
❌ High setup: $20K-100K+ initial investment
❌ Maintenance: Must monitor and update
❌ Lower accuracy: Open-source models < GPT-4
❌ Complexity: Need ML/DevOps expertise
❌ Scaling: Manual capacity planning

Tech Stack:
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python)
  - Models: Llama 2, Mistral (7B)
  - Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes
  - GPU: NVIDIA A100 or similar (~$1,350/month)
```

#### Recommendation Matrix
```
Privacy is critical           → Local Models
Budget < $100/month          → Local Models
Need high accuracy           → Public API (GPT-4)
Have $1K+/month budget       → Public API
Enterprise compliance        → Private API
Rapid deployment             → Public API
Maximum customization        → Private API
Offline mode needed          → Local Models
```

#### Unified Architecture
```typescript
// Single interface, multiple backends
interface BaseAIService {
  checkGrammar(text: string): Promise<Suggestion[]>;
  getStyleSuggestions(text: string): Promise<Suggestion[]>;
  findDuplicates(document: string): Promise<DuplicateMatch[]>;
  analyzeReadability(text: string): Promise<ReadabilityScore>;
}

// Factory pattern for backend selection
const aiService = AIServiceFactory.create({
  mode: 'local' | 'public' | 'private',
  provider: 'openai' | 'google' | 'custom',
  endpoint: 'https://...'
});
```

#### Phased Rollout
- **Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** Foundation + Local Models (25h)
- **Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Public API Integration (20h)
- **Phase 3 (Week 5-6):** Private API Support (15h)
- **Phase 4 (Week 7-8):** Advanced Features (20h)

#### Security & Cost Management
- ✅ Feature flags for gradual rollout
- ✅ Rate limiting per user
- ✅ Response caching (24 hours)
- ✅ Cost tracking dashboard
- ✅ API key management (backend proxy pattern)
- ✅ User data privacy protection

#### Success Metrics
- Feature adoption: >40% of users
- Suggestion accuracy: >90%
- Avg latency: <500ms (local), <1s (API)
- False positive rate: <5%
- Cost per user: <$5-20/month

| #5 | Low | CSS-only, doesn't affect functionality |
| #6 | Low | New component, doesn't modify existing views |
| #8 | Low | New export module, isolated from UI |
| #9 | Very Low | Performance refactoring, not behavior change |
| #12 | Low | Optional feature, can be disabled |
