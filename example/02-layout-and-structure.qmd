# Article Layout Features

This document demonstrates Quarto's flexible article layout system.

## Body Column Layout

### Standard Body Column

This is the default layout. Content is centered in the main body column with adequate margins.

::: {.column-body}
Content in the explicit body column (the default for most content).
:::

### Body Outset

::: {.column-body-outset}
This content extends beyond the body column width but not to the full page width. This is useful for slightly wider content like wider tables or figures.

It provides breathing room while maintaining the reading flow.
:::

## Page Column Layout

### Full Page Width

::: {.column-page}
This content extends to the full page width, perfect for wide tables, large figures, or full-width visualizations that benefit from extra space.

The full page width is typically about 900-1000 pixels depending on the window size.
:::

### Page Inset

::: {.column-page-inset}
Page inset provides full page width but with some left and right padding/margins. This is useful when you want maximum width but still want some breathing room.
:::

## Screen Column Layout

### Full Screen Width

::: {.column-screen}
This content extends to fill the entire screen width (often called "bleed" layout). This is the widest possible layout, perfect for full-width interactive visualizations or very large content.

It breaks out of all column constraints and uses the full viewport width.
:::

### Screen Inset

::: {.column-screen-inset}
Screen inset provides the full screen width but maintains inset margins. This balances the expansive width with some visual containment.
:::

## Margin Content

### Margin Notes

This paragraph has an accompanying margin note.

::: {.column-margin}
This is a margin note. It appears in the right margin alongside the main content. Margin notes are perfect for asides, additional context, and supplementary information without cluttering the main text.
:::

Here's another paragraph.

::: {.column-margin}
Multiple margin notes can appear throughout the document, and they'll align vertically with their associated content.
:::

### Margin Figures

```{python}
#| fig-column: margin
#| fig-cap: "Margin figure"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
plt.figure(figsize=(5, 3))
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))
plt.title("Sine Wave in Margin")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Margin figures are great for supplementary visualizations.

### Margin Tables

| Item | Count |
|------|-------|
| A | 10 |
| B | 20 |

: Simple table in margin {#tbl-margin}

## Asides

Asides are margin content without footnote styling:

::: {.aside}
This is an aside. It's different from margin notes because it doesn't use footnote numbering and has slightly different styling. Use this for optional commentary that's not essential to the main narrative.
:::

## Reference and Citation Locations

### Footnotes in Margin

With `reference-location: margin`, footnotes appear in the right margin instead of at the bottom of the page[^1].

[^1]: This footnote appears in the margin because of the document's front matter setting.

### Bibliography in Margin

With `citation-location: margin`, citations also appear in the margin, keeping the main text clean and uncluttered.

## Combined Layouts

### Wide Content with Margin Note

::: {.column-page}

This is a wider column for content.

:::

::: {.column-margin}
This margin note accompanies the wider content above.
:::

## Page Breaks

You can insert page breaks for print output:

```
{{< pagebreak >}}
```

::: {.callout-note}
Page breaks work best for PDF and DOCX output. They have minimal effect on HTML display.
:::

## Landscape Mode

::: {.landscape}
This section uses landscape orientation. For HTML, it's just a visual class, but for PDF/DOCX output, this section will be rotated to landscape.

Useful for very wide tables or figures that need extra space.
:::

## Grid Customization

The default Quarto grid provides:
- Left margin (for margin content)
- Body column (default content)
- Right margin (for margin notes)
- Sidebar area (for navigation)

This flexible grid allows content to flow naturally while providing these specialized areas.

## Layout in Code Blocks

### Figure in Body

```{python}
#| column: body
#| fig-cap: "Figure in body column"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
plt.plot(np.linspace(0, 10, 100), np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100)))
plt.title("Body Column Figure")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Figure in Page

```{python}
#| column: page
#| fig-cap: "Figure in page column"

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 4))

for i, ax in enumerate(axes):
    ax.plot(np.linspace(0, 10, 100), np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100) + i))
    ax.set_title(f"Plot {i+1}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Responsive Behavior

All column layouts are responsive:
- On desktop: Full column system with margins
- On tablet: Adjusted column widths
- On mobile: Content stacks in single column

## Best Practices

1. **Body column**: Use for main narrative text
2. **Page column**: Wide tables, large figures
3. **Screen column**: Interactive visualizations, hero images
4. **Margin notes**: Supplementary information, asides
5. **Page breaks**: Only necessary for print output

## Summary

Quarto's layout system provides:
- Multiple column widths for different content types
- Margin space for notes and supplementary content
- Flexible positioning options for figures and tables
- Responsive design that adapts to screen size
- Integration with reference and citation management
