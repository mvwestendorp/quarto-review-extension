The concept is discussed extensively [@knuth1984, pp. 33-35]. You can also use chapters [@knuth1984, ch. 2] or sections [@einstein1905, sec. 3].

### Citations with Prefixes and Suffixes

[See @knuth1984 for more details; also @einstein1905].

Contrary to @wickham2015, some researchers argue otherwise.
