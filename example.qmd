# Introduction

This is a sample document created to test the Web Review extension for Quarto. This document demonstrates various features that can be reviewed and commented on.

## Text Paragraphs

Here is a paragraph that reviewers can comment on. They can select specific text portions and add contextual comments. This paragraph contains multiple sentences to demonstrate text selection capabilities.

The review system should allow for:

- Adding comments to selected text
- Suggesting changes to paragraphs
- Tracking all modifications
- Exporting review data

## Code Blocks

Reviewers can also comment on code blocks and suggest improvements:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let item of items) {
        total += item.price * item.quantity;
    }
    return total;
}
```

This function could be optimized or might need error handling for edge cases.

## Mathematical Expressions

The extension should handle mathematical content as well:

$$E = mc^2$$

This famous equation demonstrates how mathematical expressions are handled in the review process.

## Lists and Structure

1. First item that can be reviewed
2. Second item with potential for improvement
3. Third item demonstrating list functionality

### Subsection Example

This subsection demonstrates hierarchical content structure. Reviewers should be able to comment on headers, modify text, and suggest structural changes.

## Images and Figures

While this example doesn't include images, the extension is designed to handle figure comments and annotations as well.

## Conclusion

This document serves as a comprehensive test case for the Web Review extension. It includes various content types that typically appear in academic and technical documents created with Quarto.

The extension should preserve the original document structure while adding collaborative review capabilities.
